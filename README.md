# County-Level Analysis of Covid-19 Vaccination rate in the United States

##Overview
This project analyzes county-level COVID-19 vaccination rates across the U.S. to identify key factors influencing vaccine uptake, such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and state policies. By examining regional disparities and outliers, the analysis provides insights into vaccination trends and their correlation with infection rates. The findings help inform data-driven strategies to improve vaccine coverage and public health interventions.

##Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

•	Analyzing vaccination data at the county level in the United States to identify variations in vaccination rates among communities.
•	Examining the role of vaccine hesitancy in shaping vaccination behavior.
•	Identifying counties with significantly higher or lower vaccination rates compared to neighboring areas and investigate underlying reasons.
•	Determining how different age groups influence the vaccination rates at county level.
